##### Policy: Agenda building and administration

##### Policy: Async governance process (TLC)
1. Create a pull request from your proposal. Put your tension in the description of the pull request.
2. Members of the circle have 3 workdays to ask Clarifying Questions, give Reactions, voice Objections. Every pull request is automatically posted to Slack's #governance.
   - You can show your support with :+1: ( that is _colon_ + "+1" + _colon_ )
   - If you have a Clarifying Question and it block you from deciding if you have an Objection mark your question with :question: ( that is _colon_ + "question" + _colon_ ). This blocks the proposal until the proposer clarifies.
   - Mark your Objections with :exclamation: ( that is _colon_ + "exclamation" + _colon_ ). This signs to the proposer that the current from of the proposal would degrade the capacity of the Circle to express its Purpose or enact its Accountabilities. (See the [Constitution for the criteria for valid objections](https://github.com/holacracyone/Holacracy-Constitution/blob/master/Holacracy-Constitution.md#324-criteria-for-valid-objections))
   - If you don't read the proposal in this time it's like when you don't attend the governance meeting. If the accepted proposal created tensions in your roles, please bring the tension and your proposal for the next governance meeting or create a new pull request.
3. You can amend and clarify your proposal, integrate objections by adding changes to the pull request. The time window for Clarifying Questions, Reactions and Objections restart with each amendment or clarification.
4. Any core circle member can merge the pull request if there are no objections in the given period.

https://www.posta.hu/static/internet/download/Meghatalmazas_nyomtatvany_20141021.pdf

##### Policy: Conflict resolution process
Applies to any type of disagreement. This could be a difference of opinion about a technical decision, an interpersonal conflict or a breach of values. Specifically, it can be used in performance issues when one colleague believes that another is not pulling his weight.

Since the disagreement is private, all parties are expected to respect confidentiality during and after the processes. Of course, this confidentiality also applies to the two persons at the heart of the conflict. They must resolve their disagreement between themselves and are discouraged from spreading the conflict by enlisting support and building rival factions.

 1. Whatever the topic, the process starts with one person asking another to gain agreement: In a first phase, they sit together and try to sort it out privately. Both parties should use NonViolent Communication practices to communicate clear Observation, Feelings, Needs, Requests and Responses

   - Observation: the facts (what we are seeing, hearing, or touching) as distinct from our evaluation of meaning and significance. NVC discourages static generalizations. It is said that "When we combine observation with evaluation others are apt to hear criticism and resist what we are saying." Instead, a focus on observations specific to time and context is recommended.
   - Feelings: emotions or sensations, free of thought and story. These are to be distinguished from thoughts (e.g., "I feel I didn't get a fair deal") and from words colloquially used as feelings but which convey what we think we are (e.g., "inadequate"), how we think others are evaluating us (e.g., "unimportant"), or what we think others are doing to us (e.g., "misunderstood", "ignored"). Feelings are said to reflect whether we are experiencing our needs as met or unmet. Identifying feelings is said to allow us to more easily connect with one another, and allowing ourselves to be vulnerable by expressing our feelings can help resolve conflicts.
   - Needs: universal human needs, as distinct from particular strategies for meeting needs.
   - Request: request for a specific action, free of demand. Requests are distinguished from demands in that one is open to hearing a response of "no" without this triggering an attempt to force the matter. If one makes a request and receives a "no" it is recommended not that one give up, but that one empathize with what is preventing the other person from saying "yes," before deciding how to continue the conversation. It is recommended that requests use clear, positive, concrete action language.
   - Response: The receiving person has to respond clearly to the request:
     - with a "yes"
     - needs that prevent you from saying yes,
     - and/or a counterproposal.


 1. If they can’t find a solution agreeable to both of them, they nominate a colleague they both trust to act as a mediator. The mediator doesn’t impose a decision. Rather he or she supports the participants in coming to their own solution.

 1. If mediation fails, a panel of topic-relevant colleagues is convened. The panel’s role, again, is to listen and help shape agreement. It cannot force a decision, but usually carries enough moral weight for matters to come to a conclusion.

 1. In an ultimate step, the Top Level Circle Lead Link, can be called into the panel, to further reinforce the panel’s moral weight (but not to impose a solution).
