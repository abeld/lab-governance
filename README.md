## Domain: All functions & activities within the Circle (TLC only)

### Policy: Agenda building and administration
 - Proposals are announced and written down in English in the beginning
 - Again at the end
 - Put your proposal in words before the governance meeting in a Pull Request.

### Policy: Async governance process (TLC)
1. Create a pull request from your proposal. Put your tension in the description of the pull request.
2. Members of the circle have 3 workdays to ask Clarifying Questions, give Reactions, voice Objections. Every pull request is automatically posted to Slack's #governance.
   - You can show your support with :+1: ( that is _colon_ + "+1" + _colon_ )
   - If you have a Clarifying Question and it block you from deciding if you have an Objection mark your question with :question: ( that is _colon_ + "question" + _colon_ ). This blocks the proposal until the proposer clarifies. 
   - Mark your Objections with :exclamation: ( that is _colon_ + "exclamation" + _colon_ ). This signs to the proposer that the current from of the proposal would degrade the capacity of the Circle to express its Purpose or enact its Accountabilities. (See the [Constitution for the criteria for valid objections](https://github.com/holacracyone/Holacracy-Constitution/blob/master/Holacracy-Constitution.md#324-criteria-for-valid-objections))
   - If you don't read the proposal in this time it's like when you don't attend the governance meeting. If the accepted proposal created tensions in your roles, please bring the tension and your proposal for the next governance meeting or create a new pull request.
3. You can amend and clarify your proposal, integrate objections by adding changes to the pull request. The time window for Clarifying Questions, Reactions and Objections restart with each amendment or clarification.
4. Merge the pull request if there are no objections in the given period.

### Policy: Penatly for being late from TLC stad-ups and meetings

Except when someone lets the others know that s/he is not coming at least 1h before the meeting, and the meeting should be started without them 
Facilitator keeps the log 
Old Brickflow beer debts are brought to the Brickflow farewell party 
Postponing a meeting is OK if all parties agreed

Devices
- Cell phone up to 400 EUR + VAT. iPhone (as it is more expensive) can only be paid, if the person is an iOS developer or if it is a must have for his or her work for another reason. If the employee wants to buy a more expensive device then the difference must be reimbursed. In case the employee would leave the company, he or she should buy that phone from the company on the market price.

### Policy: Probation
Probation period: 3 months.
After probation time, employees gain
- access to company credit cards

### Policy: Company purchases
If you need to purchase some asset or service for the company (and you have passed the 3rd month of your employment) you can buy it (preferably with the company card to ease administration) up to 200 EUR/year/asset class.
- Give the invoice to the finance role and add the newly purchased asset to the asset inventory.
- Before deciding on the purchase take advice from the roles/people the purchase will affect.
- To help the company, you can invoice for the company: 1. services (taxi, flgiht ticket to London but to Mallorca, etc) and 2. devices (anything we could potentially use in a client or internal product project, like a smart watch, but its price is below 100k HUF). If using the company card, you have to pre-validate with the finance and admin roles. If requested, you have to be able to bring that device to the company. If you leave the company, you have to consult with finance and admin roles to get it out from the company inventory. If the company can reimburse you the VAT than it would do so, which is the finance role's call.

If it is above 200 EUR or you do not want to make the decision yourself you can ask the finance role about the purchase.

If you do not want to do the purchase yourself ask the office role.

### Policy: Financial Liability Accounting
To account any kinds of financial liabilities, we use [Splitwise](https://www.splitwise.com) mobile app.
- You owe the company
- You paid something on behalf of the company, so the company owes you
- Someone in the team paid you something personal, like lunch
