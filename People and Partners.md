## Domain: Ownership system and Employee/Partner compensation

##### Policy: Probation time and ownership cliff
- Probation time is 3 months, when it comes to ownership there is a one year cliff.
- After probation time, each partner gains access to company credit cards.
- Peer review should happen at the end of each months of the probation time, which can impact seniorty and glue, so salary increase or decrease could happen as we learn more about a new partner.

##### Policy: Part-time
- If you are an `x%` part-time employee in the Lab, you get `x%` pay and `x%` ownership.
- You can't go above 100%

##### Policy: Part-time ratio retroactive adjustments
If your commitment was `x%` part-time but you spent significantly more `y%` of your efforts on the Lab you can retroactively adjust your part-time ratio.

- With the explicit support of the two people you most worked with.
- You may only change your part-time ratio for periods after last divident pay.
- Update your part-time percent value in the slary sheet.

##### Policy: Salary process
Assessments based on Level and Glue indicators.
 1. self assessment
 2. peer feedback with name (you'll only see your responses)

 4. display results + pitch + questions
 5. self-set levels and glue can be challenged by anyone until the next work day. Use the conflict resolution process.

There is a FedEx day (a 24 hour "hackatlon") on the first Friday of every 3rd month. (First occasion: 2015-07-03) Every kind of project is welcomed (does not have to be Lab related). The teams have to arrive with a proposal and deliver the full project at the end of the day.
