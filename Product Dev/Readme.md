##### Policy: Bugfixing for clients
Risk of bugs is managed in the planning phase preferably. 
When time is needed for bugfixing it is communicated towards clients transparently, and financially dealt with according to the contract.

##### Policy: Client relations
Each project has a responsible. 
Sales hands over the project once the deal is signed.

##### Policy: Client timeboxing
If someone needs to work on a client job outside of the allocated timebox let the others (especially TLC lead link) know 
Dedicate weekly 4 hours for the tactical and governance meeting.

##### Policy: Project leading
Every project lead has to take responsibility in organizing meetings, liaising with clients, and do resource management for the project → mini project management 
No other person (TLC lead link) should get into mini-projects
