## All functions & activities within the Circle

### Meetings
- _Standup_: report last day's achievments and the plan for next day on Slack #standup
- _Tactical, governance, demo_: retrospective before the demo meeting
  - go through the tickets
  - if a ticket is not DONE by the time of the retrospective:
    move it to the next sprint
  - next sprint planning: reestimate remaining tickets
  - fill the todo after the demo, create clarification tasks for anything uncertain
  - if there is a call for reactions of any kind, you may positively sign that you do not have a reaction by putting your hand on the table

### Branching
- Use `master` branch
- Codeship deploys to production
- Use feature branches if needed
- Force push to `stage` to deploy your code to staging

### Definition of DONE
- works locally
- has tests, unit tests, integration tests including UI interaction and mocked server
- Looks good enough for the user to understand it (not less usable than the original version if there is such)
- codeship success
- deployed and works in production

### A well defined task
- only contains at maximum 1 new UI component
- Acceptance criteria on the cards, as subtasks

### Before starting a task commit test cases without bodies and review them together
Our aim is to have the test titles ready before the estimation

### If you run into foundation stuff, make a card for it so that others are aware

### Codeship
- When you finish for the day, make sure that codeship is green. Revert if needed.

### Transparent client communication
Share any results of client communication that effects the group publicly. That can be easily done if you follow these guidelines:
 - When you chat with Visibl make sure to use a public slack channel.
 - When you email With Visibl make sure visibl@lab.coop is on CC
 - When you have a call with Visibl put the outputs to Asana tasks/comments or take notes to slack.
