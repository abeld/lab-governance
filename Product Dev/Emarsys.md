### Policy: Dependency resolution
The assignee should resolve any emerging dependency for the current week.

### Policy: Estimation
Next week's commitment is reestimated by the team before the demo, 
taking the roadmap into account.
UI tasks' estimation must be based on existing and approved mockups.
If a UI task has backend dependencies, then the backend and frontend tasks must be defined in
separate tasks in the same user story.
If there is lack of information to estimate a user story, then estimation is
forbidden and has to be marked.

### Policy: Development process
- To do

### Policy: JIRA usage
On the Monday-meeting we copy the tasks from the backlog. 
We set the assignee and the assigner, we discuss and clarify all the AC. 
We add external dependencies as tasks for the Emarsys staff. 
If you find a bug add it to JIRA backlog.

### Policy: QA
Every task must have someone who will assure its quality. 
He/She has to check on the staging environment whether all AC are met. 
Every task have to be QA-d by its assigner in JIRA with special attention to edge cases.
