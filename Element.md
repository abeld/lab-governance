## All functions & activities within the Circle

#### Policy: Async governance process

We use the same Async governance process as TLC. A pull request becomes eligible for async once it is posted to #element on Slack.

#### Policy: Time tracking and timesheet

We track time spent with the project on a half day basis. Time spent on the project is logged on Toggle individually. The timesheet (https://www.dropbox.com/s/j90lkq5txpsgs01/timesheet%20lab%20element.xlsx?dl=0), which is shared with the client, is filled by the Admin role on a weekly basis based on Toggle logs.
